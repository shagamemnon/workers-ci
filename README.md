# Workers CI
> Node.js client for automating and testing Cloudflare Workers deployments.

## Install as standalone app
```bash
npm install gulp@next -g --save
git clone https://github.com/shagamemnon/workers-ci.git && cd workers-ci && npm install
```

## Install via npm
```bash
# Gulp 4 required
npm i workers-ci --save
npm install gulp@next -g --save
```

## Setup
1. Write and store all your local Worker scripts in `workers` or `worker-bundles`
2. Set environment variables:
```bash
printf "ZONE=my-cloudflare-website.com
API_KEY=MY_CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY
EMAIL=MY_CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL" >> .env
```

```bash
gulp workers
```

### Use with CLI
```bash
# Deploy your Worker to Cloudflare every time you press save
gulp workers.live

# Deploy a Worker from the deployments folder
gulp workers.deploy --script=my-worker

# Download a Worker from Cloudflare into your local Workers folder
gulp workers.download --script=my-worker

# Delete a Worker from Cloudflare
gulp workers.delete --script=my-worker

# Using Rollup to bundle the script file in /worker-bundles and deploy to Cloudflare Workers
gulp workers.rollup

# View all routes
gulp workers.routes.get

# Create a route
gulp workers.routes.create --route=example.com/path/*

# Delete a route
gulp workers.routes.delete --route=example.com/path/*

```

### Use with an existing app
```javascript
// app.js

const workersCI = require('workers-ci')

// Create a route
workersCI.createRoute({
  hostname: `www.${process.env.ZONE}`,
  pattern: '/path/to/*',
  enabled: false
})
